# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Serena Chen, Hugo Hu
       
# IDEAS:

1) photo editor implementing various common image manipulations, such as exposure, saturation, tint, white balance, cropping, denoise**, sharpening, etc. Inspiration will be taken from the UI of the iOS Photos Editor, features from [DxO PhotoLab 7](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/), and inspiration for implementing some of these features will be through our kernels lab.
3) planetary orbit simulation of our solar system, with computational tools to see data such as orbital period, next closest approach to earth, parade of planets, lunar/solar eclipse time predictions. Inspiration from [NASA](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/home), but 2D.
4) Tetris (we've run out of ideas, but we take inspiration from the original tetris game, an example of which can be found at tetr.io)
