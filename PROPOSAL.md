# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Serena Chen, Hugo Hu
       
# IDEAS:

1) photo editor implementing various common image manipulations, such as exposure, saturation, tint, white balance, cropping, denoise**, sharpening, etc. Some of these will be kernel based (very similar to what we did in class), but some will not. Inspiration: iOS Photos Editor, [DxO PhotoLab 7](https://www.dxo.com/dxo-photolab/).
2) planetary orbit simulation of our solar system, with computational tools to see data such as orbital period, next closest approach to earth, parade of planets, lunar/solar eclipse time predictions. Inspiration from [NASA](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/home), but 2D.
3) Tetris (we've run out of ideas, but we take inspiration from the original tetris game, an example of which can be found at tetr.io)
