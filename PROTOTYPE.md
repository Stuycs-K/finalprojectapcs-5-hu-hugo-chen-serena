## Summary

We will build a photo editor with a simple UI (i.e., the one on your phone). We will have simple features like
adjusting image saturation, exposure, and cropping. We will also have some more advanced image manipulation
options available, like horizon levelling and de-noising.

## Expanded Description

### Critical Features

After 1.5 weeks, we will have at least the following in our MVP:

- Load / Save images into processing
- Basic image manipulations (integrating some of our kernels used in a lab)
- Real time preview of manipulated image
- Some implementation of denoise and levelling

### Nice To Haves

- Denoise and Levelling that actually work well
- Read image EXIF data and display in editor (EXIF data is the metadata of an image, including camera model / lens / image settings)
