# Project Description

!["logo" of photomarket](./images/adobe-photoshop-cc-logo-png_seeklogo-268287_PROCESSING.jpg)
Photomarket (Pm) is a photo editor application that allows users to apply basic image manipulations to their photos,
allowing your photo to get your desired look and feel.

# Intended usage

Photomarket has several image manipulations available: Blur, Sharpen, Exposure, Saturation, Moireing, Vignetting,
and Cropping.

|Function|Interface|Description|
| ---- | ---- | ------------------- |
| Blur | Button | Uses a kernel-based blurring mechanism to blur the entire image. Produces a dreamy effect. |
| Sharpening | Button | Uses a kernel-based sharpening mechanism to implement the hollywood "enhance" feature. |
| Exposure | Button +/- | Adjusts exposure of the image in 10% intervals relative to the source image. Use the +/- exposure buttons to correct for under/over-exposed images. |
| Saturation | Button +/- | Did your picture come out boring and flat? Dull, lifeless? Didn't have a crappy 2000s digicam that artificially boosted saturation for you? Just increase / decrease your saturation in 10% intervals with +/- buttons to either create an unrealistic vivid image, or a flat and boring monotone one. |
| Moireing | Button | Works best on high resolution files, which are currently being re-sized to 1080p to improve performance. |
| Vignetting | Button | Darkens the corners in a radial fashion, to simulate a natural phenomenon in optics with dropoff at the edges.Increase vignetting to put the focus on the center subject. |
| Crop | SPACE + ARROWS | Was your image composition horrible? Couldn't zoom in farther? You're in luck! Using this non-proprietary cropping function, you too can get closer to your subject, without walking, only at the expense of resolution! After turning the crop guide on via the button, use SPACE to pick which border you're cropping, then use
arrow keys to move the cropping guides. |
